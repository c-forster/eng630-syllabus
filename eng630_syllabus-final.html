<h1 id="course-description-and-objectives">Course Description and Objectives</h1>
<p>How does the becoming digital of textuality (of the very medium of most literary study) alter the character of what we do with texts? To judge from some accounts, digital technology promises to radically change the study of literature and culture. At one extreme, some critics have suggested that such technologies can enable new modes of &quot;distant reading&quot;: literary criticism as data mining. In this class we will explore these claims by reading some of the key works in the field/discipline/methodology which currently parades under the banner <em>digital humanities</em>.<span class="footnote">While <em>digital humanities</em> has received an increased attention starting around 2009; it can be traced back through &quot;humanities computing&quot; to a first wave of interest in the 1990s, and even further to the earliest uses of computers for humanistic scholarship—an origin frequently identified with Father Roberto Busa, who used computers to generate his lemmatized index to the work of Thomas Aquinas. You can find that index online at <a href="http://www.corpusthomisticum.org">http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/</a>.</span></p>
<p>This class will invite students to consider and to explore (though not uncritically) the promises of these new methodologies. Our focus will be chiefly on using new tools to understand (old) texts. Rather than theorize new media or read digital poetry, we will be considering the nature of literary study in a digital age. Readings will include work by Jerome McGann, Franco Moretti, Stephen Ramsay, and others. We will also be trying out hands at a few of these tools to try to explore the sorts of questions such methodologies allow us to ask (and, perhaps, answer); we will also try to remain to sensitive to whether the questions we now explore are, in fact, questions worth exploring.</p>

<h1 id="course-assignments">Course Assignments</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blogging &amp; Commenting</strong>: As part of this course you will set up a blog (or use an existing personal blog) and regularly write short posts (500-1000 words) in response to the material we read. You will be required to post once every two weeks, and to comment on at least one of your peer's posts every week. You are strongly encouraged to write more frequently (even short, perhaps  entries) in addition to these required entries, and to comment more frequently than is required. Indeed, these &quot;requirements&quot; are merely a scaffold intended to jumpstart<span class="note">Mixed metaphor; do not attempt to literally jumpstart literal scaffolds.</span> our small community. (Just as a <em>grade</em> is not the goal of a class, but merely a way to help &quot;incentivize&quot; <span class="note">Is it meaningful that my spellchecker lacks this bit of neoliberal jargon?</span> learning.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group Bibliography</strong>: As we read we will also be compiling a shared Zotero bibliography of relevant materials. Weeks that you are not blogging, you are required to find and read (or examine) at least one relevant resource and add it to our shared bibliography. This may be a relevant article, resource, archive, or blog post you find on your own; it may be tracking down an item cited in some of the material we're reading (or a response thereto). Whatever it is, you should add it to our shared group bibliography with a brief annotation (3-5 sentences) summarizing the item and explaining the item. I hope this shared bibliography will provide a benefit to everyone by providing some avenues (lines of flight?) to move beyond the assigned readings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Project</strong>: The concluding weeks of this class will be dedicated to a &quot;final project&quot; which we will begin thinking about collectively from the first class. The exact contours of this project will be determined collectively. This project may take the form of a conventional looking seminar paper on issues of digitization, quantitative analysis, the epistemology of humanistic inquiry (or some other relevant topic). It may be an essay on a particular text or corpus which makes its argument using some of the methods we have discussed. It might also be a digital project of some kind (something, to invoke a favorite DH term, <em>built</em><span class="note">To see an extended conversation on this topic, see Stephen Ramsay's <a href="http://stephenramsay.us/text/2011/01/11/on-building.html">&quot;On Building&quot;</a> and the lively discussion it produced.</span> completed individually or, more likely if individuals are interested in pursuing such a thing, as a group.</p>
<p>I understand that the open-endedness of this project can be somewhat frightening. This open-endedness is an invitation to try to understand the virtues (and challenges) of digital projects. That opportunity, of necessity, must also include the possibility of trying something which doesn't completely work out—that is, it must include the possibility of <em>failure</em>.<span class="note">Like <em>building</em>, there is a reasonable case that <em>failure</em> is one of the keywords of <em>digital humanites</em>. It is also, for better or worse, a keyword for silicon-valley entrepeneurs. See, for instance: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nyuentrepreneurschallenge/2012/10/16/fail-fast-succeed-faster/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/nyuentrepreneurschallenge/2012/10/16/fail-fast-succeed-faster/</a>. Whether a connection exists between these two notions of failure and its importance is an exercise left to the reader.</span> Be assured, a project which fails in its initial goals will not necessarily fail as an assignment for this class.</p></li>
